# Samford Community Kindergarten Philosophy

“IT TAKES A VILLAGE TO RAISE A CHILD”

At Samford, we believe that childhood is a unique time of life to be valued and enjoyed. Children develop their sense of belonging by celebrating the richness of the history of Samford Kindergarten and the connections the centre has with community past, present and future.

* Our semi-rural environment provides us with the unique opportunity to embrace country life with strong community involvement.
* We acknowledge that children come from diverse backgrounds and bring unique strengths, experiences and understandings of their world .It is these strengths, experiences and understandings that help to give the children their sense of being.
* We believe that children learn best in a flexible environment, where exploration, discovery, curiosity and play are the cornerstones of our program.
* Play can provide insights into children’s interests, skills, beliefs and joys. A happy atmosphere is conducive to fostering positive self-esteem and developing life skills which in turn will help children develop their sense of becoming an individual.
* We provide a safe, caring and engaging environment where all children are encouraged to make decisions about their own learning. Children are supported to develop resilience and the skills to manage challenges and new situations with confidence.
* We promote conservation and encourage children and families to protect the environment both native flora and fauna.

In relation to children, we believe that:

* learning is a lifelong process;
* children learn best in a flexible environment, where exploration, discovery, curiosity and play are the main focus and where ‘hands-on’ experiences are valued;
* children live in a rapidly changing world. Listening, negotiating, compromising, sharing, respecting self and others, risk taking, problem solving and resilience are key skills for life;
* we need to support children’s exploration of the natural world and foster sustainable practices.

In relation to families and community, we recognise:

* families are their child’s first and most important teachers;
* and support strong connections built on trust and a sense of belonging;
* the Turrbal and the Yuggera people as the traditional owners of this land.

As educators, we:

* embed the Early Years Learning Framework for Australia and use the C&K ‘Building Waterfalls’ and National Quality Standards  to guide our daily practice;
* recognise strengths in children, families, colleagues and the community;
* foster a collaborative approach where all staff are respected as individuals and as a valuable part of the team;
* promote and value ongoing professional development and reflective practice, and our commitment to continuous improvement.
