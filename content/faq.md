**Do you have a siblings policy?**

After much discussion it was decided that it would be fairer to all families not to have a siblings policy.

**Is there an area management plan?**

At this stage no, we are happy to take children from the Samford and neighbouring areas. Preference is given according to the waiting list not the area of residence.

**Are there incursions included in the Kindy program?**

We do have an interesting program of visiting productions and presentations for children each year that is included in your program.

**Do I have to pay fees when my child is sick or on holidays?**

Yes,Â fees are based on children attending all programmed days and that is why fees are payable for the Kindy program whether your child attends or not.

**Will I be encouraged to take part in fundraising activities?**

Because we are a community kindergarten, we need to supplement our government funding through applying for grants and fundraising. Fund raising is an important source of additional funds for resources and improvements.
