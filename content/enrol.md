# **Waiting lists**

[**Apply here (online) for 2018/2019/2020/2021/2022 waiting lists**](https://carlosaya.github.io/SCK/waiting-list/index.html).

Waiting list places are determined by receipt of both the form and fee (whether this is completed online or in person). The $30 non-refundable waiting list fee **must** be received by Samford Community Kindergarten **within 3 working days** of the form being submitted, otherwise your submission is unfortunately invalid.

To place your child’s name on the waiting list, parents are asked to complete the online waiting list form and pay a non-refundable waiting list fee of $30. The completed booking form will be sent to us and you will receive a confirmation email. You will then be required to pay via direct deposit or by visiting a Bendigo Bank branch to complete payment of the booking fee.

Your child’s name may be placed on the waiting list from the 1st of July of the year following his or her birth (please refer to the table below). Children are enrolled at the Centre in order of placement on the waiting list. As waiting lists are usually long at Samford Kindy, we advise placing children’s names on the list as soon as possible. It is the policy of both Samford Community Kindergarten and C&K that we do not disclose your child’s number on our waiting list.

Families are offered places for their children from the July prior to the year they will attend. Upon accepting the offer, an enrolment fee is payable. This fee is made up of a Working Bee Levy, Mowing Levy and Membership Fee. The enrolment fee is non-refundable if the child is withdrawn from Kindy.

By completing the waiting list form and submitting the booking fee payment you agree to the following:

* that the form is for the waiting list only.
* that it is my responsibility to notify the Centre of any changes to my contact details.
* that children are enrolled at the Centre in order of placement on the waiting list.

**Year of attendance**

Children must be at least 4 years old by 30 June in the year they are enrolled in an approved kindergarten program.

**Immunisation Policy**                                                                                                       

On 11th May 2017  the Samford Community Kindergarten Committee  conducted a vote of the current 2017 parents for the introduction of the Immunisation Policy. The results of this vote were unanimously for the introduction of the Immunisation Policy. This policy will be effective as of 1 January 2018.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 2017 Executive Committee Samford Community Kindergarten

**Queensland Kindergarten Funding Scheme (QKFS)**

If your child is of eligible age, our service may be entitle to claim QKFS funding on behalf of you child. If your child is enrolled at another kindergarten program and they are claiming the QKFS for your child, our service will not be able to claim the funding. You will need to notify us if your child is enrolled and claiming at another kindergarten.

Please be advised that Samford Community Kindergarten does not have a sibling policy.
