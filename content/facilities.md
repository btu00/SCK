Samford Kindergarten boasts an enviable range of resources and facilities, including stimulating indoor and outdoor environments. Our library meets children’s desires to curl-up and read, and our creative program encourages children to explore their creative tendencies.

Outdoor play areas feature a vegetable patch, fairy garden, sand, water and a wide range of adventure play equipment.  These play areas include paved and covered areas, ensuring that children can enjoy outdoor activities throughout the year.

Since 2014  we have continued rejuvenating our outdoor environment.

In 2015 Our Parent community have helped us plant native trees and shrubs to increase our native flora and fauna and  our vegetable gardens have been producing wonderful vegetables each year.

In 2016  We are fortunate to have received a Road safety grant at the end of 2015 to build a textured bike path and begin a road safety program with the children.

In 2017 we were fortunate to receive a government grant for the renovation of our creek area and the creation of a mud kitchen. This project started and finished in September and since then the children have been enjoying playing in the mud kitchen. So much fun!!
