Samford Kindergarten has an enviable reputation for the quality of teaching, facilities and resources.

Children bring with them a rich variety of cultural and social backgrounds and experiences.  We recognise and appreciate the individuality of each child and family, and observe a policy of acceptance of race, creed, gender, disability, class or culture.

Children are encouraged to play, share and work alongside a consistent group of peers in a supportive and encouraging environment, which allows them to learn at their own pace.

## C&K

[C&K](http://www.candk.asn.au/) considers both children and childhood to be precious and, therefore, what is best for children is our highest priority.

Offering a natural learning through play concept at all C&K services enriches the lives of children and their families to achieve the C&K vision of a childhood fulfilled.

All of our services are based on respect for children with any profits reinvested in their best interest. C&K is a not for profit organisation whereby profits are respected to ensure the best outcome is achieved to benefit children and educators at our services.

Ensuring your child receives the highest quality education and care, C&K provides greater ratios of educators and assistants to children, limited use of plastics in children’s equipment and large natural outdoor play areas.

For more than 105 years, C&K has advocated as a strong voice for children’s rights to childhood. We hope you choose the C&K philosophy for your child’s early education.

## History

### 1980

### 

The first kindergarten to operate in Samford was one of the Creche and Kindergarten Association’s mobile units.  It operated three days/week at the Samford Sporting Association’s building in Richards Road.

### 1981

The committee of parents felt it was necessary to establish a permanent kindergarten in the rapidly growing Samford district.

### 1982

It became necessary to move the mobile kindergarten, but no suitable commercial premises were available.  The mobile kindergarten was moved to private property, followed by another the following year.

The Pine Rivers Shire Council granted the current block of land in Camp Mountain Rd.

### 1984

With the kind assistance of [Samford Rotary Club](http://www.samfordrotary.org.au/), Samford Community Kindergarten was officially opened in January.
