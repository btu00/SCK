**Samford Kindergarten™ provides a high quality, play-based learning environment which is nurturing, stimulating and creative whilst incorporating family and community values under the umbrella of the Office of Early Childhood Education and Care and C&K.**

We have proudly helped generations of local families since 1984, and we provide an ideal environment to immerse your child in the Samford community – where they can make friends for life!

* We are a not-for-profit kindergarten.  This means we reinvest 100% of profits back into the kindy – for the benefit of our children.
* Our Queensland Government approved program is run by an experienced, passionate and qualified early childhood teachers and teaching assistants.
* We provide a well-resourced and nurturing environment coupled with quality systems and ongoing professional development, underpinned by C& K curriculum Building Waterfalls and The Early Years Learning Framework.
* We are a specialist kindergarten and not a childcare. We have the same 22 children per group and the same staffing per group. Our curriculum and facilities are purpose-built for Kindergarten and our interests are focused solely on the Kindergarten  children. The children are immersed in the same stable environment, with the same children and teachers every day.
* Parents are encouraged to be involved within the Kindy program and on the committee (which is elected annually).  This means that parents have an opportunity to share and give input  into the direction of the kindergarten.
* Our committee is acutely aware of keeping costs down whilst providing quality education, resources and facilities for our children.

 

**Thank you to everyone who has helped support our Kindy in some way during 2017**
