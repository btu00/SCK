      <description>Samford Kindergarten has an enviable reputation for the quality of teaching, facilities and resources.
Children bring with them a rich variety of cultural and social backgrounds and experiences. We recognise and appreciate the individuality of each child and family, and observe a policy of acceptance of race, creed, gender, disability, class or culture.
Children are encouraged to play, share and work alongside a consistent group of peers in a supportive and encouraging environment, which allows them to learn at their own pace.</description>

      <description>Samford Community Kindergarten Philosophy “IT TAKES A VILLAGE TO RAISE A CHILD”
At Samford, we believe that childhood is a unique time of life to be valued and enjoyed. Children develop their sense of belonging by celebrating the richness of the history of Samford Kindergarten and the connections the centre has with community past, present and future.
 Our semi-rural environment provides us with the unique opportunity to embrace country life with strong community involvement.</description>

      <description>Do you have a siblings policy?
After much discussion it was decided that it would be fairer to all families not to have a siblings policy.
Is there an area management plan?
At this stage no, we are happy to take children from the Samford and neighbouring areas. Preference is given according to the waiting list not the area of residence.
Are there incursions included in the Kindy program?
We do have an interesting program of visiting productions and presentations for children each year that is included in your program.</description>
