      <description>Samford Kindergarten has an enviable reputation for the quality of teaching, facilities and resources.
Children bring with them a rich variety of cultural and social backgrounds and experiences. We recognise and appreciate the individuality of each child and family, and observe a policy of acceptance of race, creed, gender, disability, class or culture.
Children are encouraged to play, share and work alongside a consistent group of peers in a supportive and encouraging environment, which allows them to learn at their own pace.</description>

      <description>Samford Community Kindergarten Philosophy “IT TAKES A VILLAGE TO RAISE A CHILD”
At Samford, we believe that childhood is a unique time of life to be valued and enjoyed. Children develop their sense of belonging by celebrating the richness of the history of Samford Kindergarten and the connections the centre has with community past, present and future.
 Our semi-rural environment provides us with the unique opportunity to embrace country life with strong community involvement.</description>

      <title>Migrate from Jekyll</title>

      <description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png  should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png  Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>

      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <description>Do you have a siblings policy?
After much discussion it was decided that it would be fairer to all families not to have a siblings policy.
Is there an area management plan?
At this stage no, we are happy to take children from the Samford and neighbouring areas. Preference is given according to the waiting list not the area of residence.
Are there incursions included in the Kindy program?
We do have an interesting program of visiting productions and presentations for children each year that is included in your program.</description>
